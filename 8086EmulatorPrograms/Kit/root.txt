MVI D, 01 – initialize register D with 01
MVI E, 01 – initialize register E with 01
LDA 2050 – loads the content of memory location 2050 in accumulator A
SUB D – subtract value of D from A
JZ 2011 – make jump to memory location 2011 if zero flag is set
INR D – increments value of register D by 1. Since it is used two times, therefore value of D is incremented by 2
INR E – increments value of register E by 1
JMP 2007 – make jump to memory location 2007
MOV A, E – moves the value of register E in accumulator A
STA 3050 – stores value of A in 3050
HLT – stops executing the program and halts any further execution
