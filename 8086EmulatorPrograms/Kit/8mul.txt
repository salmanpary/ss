LXI H, 2050 will load the HL pair register with the address 2050 of memory location.

2. MOV B, M  copies the content of memory into register B.

3. INX H will increment the address of HL pair by one and make it 2051H.

4. MOV C,M copies the content of memory into register C.

5. MVI A,00H assign 00 to A.

6. top: ADD B add the content of accumulator with register B and store the result in accumulator.

7. DCR C decrement the register C.

8. JNZ TOP jumps on top till C doesnâ€™t becomes 0.

9. INX H  will increment the address of HL pair by one and make it 2052H.

10. MOV M,A copies the content of  A which is our answer to register M.

11. HLT stops executing the program and halts any further execution.
