LDA 2050 moves the contents of 2050 memory location to the accumulator.
MOV H, A copies contents of Accumulator to register H to A
LDA 2051 moves the contents of 2051 memory location to the accumulator.
ADD H adds contents of A (Accumulator) and H register (F9). The result is stored in A itself. For all arithmetic instructions A is by default an operand and A stores the result as well
MOV L, A copies contents of A (34) to L
MVI A 00 moves immediate data (i.e., 00) to A
ADC A adds contents of A(00), contents of register specified (i.e A) and carry (1). As ADC is also an arithmetic operation, A is by default an operand and A stores the result as well
MOV H, A copies contents of A (01) to H
SHLD 3050 moves the contents of L register (34) in 3050 memory location and contents of H register (01) in 3051 memory location
